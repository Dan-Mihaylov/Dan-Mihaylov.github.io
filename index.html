                    <p>
                        I am currently deeply immersed in the world of software developement with Python. My 
                        insatiable curiosity drives me to explore various technologies and libraries. My primary focus
                        is to learn Python frameworks like Django and/or Flask for web developement. I would love to 
                        craft user-friendly web applications using those technologies with combination with HTML, CSS 
                        and CSS's framework Boostrap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond web developement, I am interested in learning PostreSQL and diving into data science with 
                        Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib. I am looking forward to learning to extract valuable insights from data
                        as well as visualising it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the fast-paced world, I am a dedicated enthusiast always ready for new challenges. My software developement 
                        jurney is not just a career choice, it is a genuine passion that fuels my innovation, creativity and desire to learn new things.
